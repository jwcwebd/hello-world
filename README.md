Hello my name is Walter Choi.
I used to be a programmer / software engineer but have since become an educator at a community college teaching basic IT related information (because a school job gives me summers off, friday's off, and decent pay and state level benefits).  But  one day I would like to return to the programming profession - preferably from home as a telecommuter.
